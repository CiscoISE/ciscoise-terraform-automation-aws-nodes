# AWS IAM Permissions and S3 Bucket Policy Explanation

This document provides an explanation of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions  that have been configured in our AWS environment.

## IAM Permissions

The IAM permissions defined in this policy are used to control access to various AWS services and resources. Here's a breakdown of the permissions:

### EC2 Permissions

- **EC2:** Permissions related to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances.
- **IAM:** Permissions related to AWS Identity and Access Management roles and policies.
- **Lambda:** Permissions related to AWS Lambda functions.
- **States:** Permissions related to AWS Step Functions.

### S3 Bucket Permissions

- **s3:** Permissions related to Amazon S3 bucket and object management.

## S3 Bucket 

The iam S3 bucket  is used to control access to the S3 bucket named `bucket-name`. The policy includes the following actions:

- `s3:PutObject`: Allowing the addition of objects to the bucket.
- `s3:GetObject`: Allowing the retrieval of objects from the bucket.
- `s3:ListBucket`: Allowing listing the objects within the bucket.
- `s3:DeleteObject`: Allowing the deletion of objects within the bucket.

The policy grants these permissions for all objects within the specified bucket.

## Note

It's important to maintain proper access control and only grant permissions to the necessary resources and actions. Regularly review and update IAM permissions and S3 bucket policies as needed to ensure security and compliance.
