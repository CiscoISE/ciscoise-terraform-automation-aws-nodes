###################################
#  Valid instance types are t3.xlarge, m5.2xlarge, c5.4xlarge, m5.4xlarge, c5.9xlarge, m5.8xlarge, m5.16xlarge
#  Allowed Storage size - (Minimum 300GB and Maximum 2400GB)
#  Allowed roles are : PrimaryAdmin, SecondaryAdmin, PrimaryMonitoring, SecondaryMonitoring, PrimaryDedicatedMonitoring, SecondaryDedicatedMonitoring, Standalone
#  Allowed services are : Session, Profiler, TC-NAC, SXP, DeviceAdmin, PassiveIdentity, pxGrid, pxGridCloud

# NOTE: For configuration, please make sure to follow the syntax as mentioned and follow below points before updating the variables
# 1. Do not pass any services or roles values for Primary PAN node in primary_instance_config variable
# 2. Secondary PAN node supports SecondaryAdmin, SecondaryMonitoring and PrimaryMonitoring roles
# 3. PSN node can act as a Mnt (Monitoring) node by assigning any one of these roles - SecondaryMonitoring, SecondaryDedicatedMonitoring, PrimaryMonitoring or PrimaryDedicatedMonitoring
# 4. Monitoring role can only be passed once across secondary_instance_config and psn_instance_config variable
# 5. Valid characters for hostnames are `ASCII(7)` letters from `a` to `z` , the digits from `0` to `9` , and the hyphen (`âˆ’`).


# Specify instance configuration for Primary PAN node. It should follow below syntax where key is the hostname and values are instance attributes
# NOTE: Hostname only supports alphanumeric characters and hyphen (-). The length of the hostname should not exceed 19 characters, otherwise deployment will fail
/*
  {
    <hostname> = {
      instance_type = "<instance_type>"
      storage_size = "<storage_size>"
    }
  }
  
   Usage example - 
   primary_instance_config = { 
    primary-ise-server = { 
      instance_type = "t3.xlarge"
      storage_size = 600 
      }
    }
   */
primary_instance_config = {
  primary-ise-server = {
    instance_type = "t3.xlarge"
    storage_size  = 500
  }
}


# Specify instance configuration for Secondary PAN node. It should follow below syntax where key is the hostname and values are instance attributes
# NOTE: Hostname only supports alphanumeric characters and hyphen (-). The length of the hostname should not exceed 19 characters, otherwise deployment will fail
/*
  {

      storage_size = "<storage_size>"
      services =  "<service_1>,<service_2>"
      roles = "<role_1>,<role_2>"
    }
  }
  Example usage -
  secondary_instance_config = {
  secondary-ise-server = {
    instance_type = "t3.xlarge"
    storage_size  = 500
    services      = "Session,Profiler,pxGrid"

    storage_size  = 500
    services      = "Session,Profiler,pxGrid"
    roles         = "SecondaryAdmin"
  }
}

# Specify instance configuration for N PSN nodes. It should follow below syntax where key is the hostname and values are instance attributes.
# NOTE: Hostname only supports alphanumeric characters and hyphen (-). The length of the hostname should not exceed 19 characters, otherwise deployment will fail
/*
 {
